# HuffmanEncoder
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code.

The Project is made majorly using Javaâ€™s Jlabel, Generic Heap, Binary Tree, HashMap and File Handling. The UI/UX contains a window maximized to its length and width containing two buttons and a text box indicating which process has undergone (Encoding Or Decoding). After both the processes the result file is saved to the disk.
